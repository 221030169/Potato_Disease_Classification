Potato Disease Classification Using Deep Learning:
#########################################


The Potato Disease Classification project is a machine learning-based web application designed to identify and diagnose common diseases in potato plants from images. Built using Streamlit for the user interface and TensorFlow for the deep learning model, the project aims to help farmers and agricultural professionals quickly detect diseases and take preventive action.

Key Features:
###########

Disease Detection: The application classifies potato leaf images into three categories: Early blight, Late blight, and Healthy.
Image Upload: Users can upload an image of a potato plant leaf in JPG or PNG format for analysis.

Confidence Score: The app displays the model's confidence percentage for each prediction, ensuring transparency and reliability.
Deep Learning Model: The model, trained on a comprehensive dataset of potato plant images, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate classification.

User-friendly Interface: Developed with Streamlit, the web app offers a clean, intuitive interface that allows users to quickly upload images and view predictions.

Visual Feedback: Based on the model's prediction, the app provides appropriate feedbackâ€”highlighting healthy plants in green and diseased plants in yellow or red.

Technologies Used:
###############

TensorFlow: For building and deploying the deep learning model.
**************
Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.
***********
PIL (Python Imaging Library): To process and resize images for prediction.
*********************************
NumPy: For efficient data handling and manipulation.
********
Python: The primary language used for development.

Project Purpose:
*******************
This project aims to help farmers and agriculture specialists make informed decisions by providing a quick and reliable way to identify common potato diseases. Early detection of these diseases can lead to better crop management and prevention, reducing losses and improving yield.
